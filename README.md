- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @don-asu
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in STEM education, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning, human movement processing, human-computer interaction, and planetary/space visualization!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about the Unity game engine (which is a lot) and MATLAB. I plan to move on to Python once I get a more firm grasp on machine learning.

- ðŸ“« You can reach me at don.balanzat@asu.edu
